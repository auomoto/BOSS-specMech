**_BOSS Spectrograph Mechanicals Controls for the LCO instrument_**

One of the two BOSS spectrographs will be moved to Las Campanas Observatory (LCO). Because existing spare parts inventory is not large enough to support two separate locations, we are replacing the obsolete items on the LCO instrument with currently available parts. One item is the microcontroller board, formerly a Z-World Little Giant, that is no longer manufactured (the original spectrograph was designed in the 1990s).

The new controller is built around a Microchip Curiosity Nano ATMega 4809. The source code and electronics schematics are here.
